- ðŸ‘¯ I would like to collaborate on Global Solutions for Global Problems:
  - ðŸ”­ Ending the brutal and terroristic policing structure. 
  - ðŸŒ± Protect and defend Encryption, Privacy, and Information.   
  - ðŸŒ± Further the arguments and build structures for Universal Basic Income. 
  - ðŸ’¬ Discuss and push for adopting a blockchain voting system, fully
       decentralized and open, as well as secure and private.  Malicious
       providence for the right-wing, and the left.  Only the People win.

- ðŸ“« Reach me at ```rebbeli@protonmail```, _encrypted_ and _signed_ please.  
     That is not necessarily for the sake of security, but _principle_. 
     You might be surprised how much you can help.
